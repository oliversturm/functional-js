- Functional - Why?
- Some Basics
- The Practical Side

## Functional - Why?

- It's a more _compact and flexible_ technique (than OO) to achieve _modularization and encapsulation_
- It suits certain _execution models_ perfectly (think request-based services)
- Functional principles result in _very stable code_ that is _extremely easy to test_
- Writing code in functions helps focus on what happens - instead of focusing on data and structural modeling
